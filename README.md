#MarkovChains
Starter for   Max Likelihood  Experiemnt  to see   if  it make   sense.
##Conclusions :
The  linear  interpolation implementation  was tested   by beyhan  on 128 gb   server    3  weeks  ago   and   the implementation  is hard   , difficult to  do     fast experiments    and in  this format   there is no empirical evidence  that could bring   better   performance  according to  predifined   optimization metric  on hold out  data sets.
